# Mapping_Earthquakes
Javascript &amp; Api's

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Technical analysis

## Deliverable 1

Adding in Tectonic Plate Data using d3.json() and geoJSON. Using the data to layer it will stand out on the map by using line strings. We connected the data through the provided github repository that contained GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json data.


## Deliverable 2

Adding in major Earth quake Data using leaflet.js and d3.json(). Also adding color, radius of the circle, and a pop-up marker.

All of the changes made using the data helps have precise details on the map. The changes made also help see the difference in light and dark mode, street, the line grpahs, and more.
